# condor2-discord-resultbot
A simple powershell script to take a results log file generated by DSHelper.exe (Condor 2 simulator), tidy it up a bit, and send it to a Discord Webhook.

*Why does this project exist?*
As exciting as Condor flying is in the moment, people liked to see how they did in a race, and that required the 'last' finisher to take a screenshot and make it available. 
Since DSHelper (not our software) produces a text file of the results at the end of a race, and we use discord - automating the transfer of that file seemed like the way forward so that we'd never miss a result and we had a log of them.

Powershell is used as this stands the best chance of being able to work without any setup on anyone's windows 10 machine.

*What's left to do?*
- OPEN class should show results for all gliders, using handicap.
- Current handicaps are FAI - change to BGA maybe?
- It might be nice to grab some task information and send it at the top of the results file; even if it's just the comments from the .fpl file (although we could grab the weather too).
- Maybe an additional script for task announcements
